# Simple Task Manager API

## Requirements

For building and running the application you need:

- [JDK 17](https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/17/)
- [Maven 3](https://maven.apache.org)
  - Before using Monitoring api you should compile and add this project. You can use this command: `mvn clean install`.


## Running the application locally

There are several ways to run a Spring Boot application on your local machine. One way is to execute the `main` method in the `ie.ali.taskmanager.TaskManagerApplication` class from your IDE.

Alternatively you can use the [Spring Boot Maven plugin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/build-tool-plugins-maven-plugin.html) like so:

```shell
mvn spring-boot:run
```
